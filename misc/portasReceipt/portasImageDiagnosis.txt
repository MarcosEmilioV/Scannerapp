The image has wrinkles along the whole paper, although the part with the most wrinkles is the bottom 3/3 part with the most 
aggresive wrinkles which mainly affects the "SubTotal" and "Iva" word. 
For the 2/3 part, meaning the middle part of the receipt, wrinkles are less agresive but there seems to be a fold wrinkle which 
in the image kind of cuts the "Gallo Pinto" word. 
The rest of the image seems pretty straight forward, there are not letter fadeaways other than the wrinkles in the image and some
lighter and darker spots on the image but nothing which gives too much contrast to human eye at least.

Background is too much noise since there are a lot of flower like figures and dots which cause unnecessary noise.
